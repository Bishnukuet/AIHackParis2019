# Tagline: Improving Women's Menstrual Health Using Recommender AI
# Paragraph:
PSlove is popular period tracker app that has been helping thousands of women around the world to track their health - during and after the period. We have using the app data (Confidential) to find the common irregularities and symptoms women at different age are experiencing based on their given information through the app. The data is incomplete in most of the cases making it very difficult to analyze. To make an effective AI to improve app functionality, more informations are important to track. For example the dietry pattern of the users having similar symptoms can help to understand the irregularities and remedies better. We propose here an improved recommender system make important information available and health care easier for the users.
